## Contents of the `robots.txt` file on [ February 21, 2025 ]

User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /

## Explanation

The `robots.txt` file specifies which web crawlers are allowed to access different parts of the website.

1.  `User-agent: *` → This means **all web crawlers** are allowed.  
2.  `Crawl-delay: 10` → Web crawlers must wait **10 seconds** between requests.  
3.  `Allow: /` → This means **we are allowed** to scrape all public pages.  
4.  `User-agent: SemrushBot` & `Disallow: /` → This blocks the **SemrushBot** crawler. Since we are not using this bot, this does not affect us.

Conclusion: We are allowed to scrape the site **as long as we respect the 10-second delay between requests.**
